Product Requirements Document: Claude-Flow AI Assistant Capabilities
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the capabilities of the Claude-Flow AI assistant. The primary goal is to leverage Claude-Flow's understanding of the associated codebase and architecture to provide comprehensive explanations, educational materials, and presentation content for various audiences.

2. Goals
The main goals for the Claude-Flow AI assistant are:

Deep Architectural Understanding: Enable the AI to articulate the intricate connections and operational flow between the different components of the Claude-Flow stack.

Knowledge Dissemination: Facilitate the creation of structured learning paths and materials to educate new users and developers on the stack.

Communication & Outreach: Empower users to effectively present and discuss the architecture with both technical and non-technical audiences.

3. Target Audience
The target audience for the outputs generated by the Claude-Flow AI assistant includes:

Internal Teams/Developers: For understanding the codebase, contributing, and onboarding.

New Users/Learners: Individuals seeking to understand the stack from a foundational level.

Conference/Event Attendees: Audiences at presentations who require a clear, concise, and engaging overview.

General Inquirers: Individuals seeking quick answers to common questions about the architecture.

4. Features/Capabilities
The Claude-Flow AI assistant will be required to perform the following specific tasks:

4.1. Architecture Explanation
Description: The AI assistant will provide a detailed explanation of how the Claude-Flow architecture is structured, how its various components interact, and how the entire system functions cohesively. This explanation should go beyond a high-level overview and delve into the roles and relationships of each module.

Requirements:

Component Breakdown: Explain each core component: ruv-FANN, QuDAG, DAA, claude-flow, and neuro-divergent.

Interoperability: Describe how these components integrate and communicate with each other.

End-to-End Flow: Illustrate the complete data and control flow through the system.

Conceptual Clarity: Use clear, concise language, avoiding excessive jargon where possible, or explaining it when necessary.

Contextualization: Relate the explanation to the provided architecture diagram ("Claude Flow Architecture.jpg") and the specific codebases.

4.2. Learning Material Generation
Description: The AI assistant will generate a structured set of learning materials designed to educate individuals on the Claude-Flow stack from the ground up. This material should be suitable for self-paced learning.

Requirements:

Curriculum Design: Propose a logical learning path, starting from foundational concepts and progressing to more advanced topics.

Module-Based Content: Break down the learning into distinct modules or lessons.

Explanatory Text: Provide clear explanations for each concept, component, and interaction.

Code Snippets/Examples (Conceptual): Include conceptual code examples or pseudo-code to illustrate key functionalities, referencing the provided GitHub repositories. Note: Actual runnable code generation is not required for this task, but references to where relevant code can be found are encouraged.

Glossary: Include a glossary of key terms.

Prerequisites: Outline any necessary prerequisite knowledge.

4.3. Presentation Material & FAQ Generation
Description: The AI assistant will create comprehensive presentation material suitable for a group speaking engagement, along with a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for the audience.

Requirements (Presentation Material):

Slide Outline: Provide a structured outline for a presentation, including suggested topics for each "slide" or section.

Key Talking Points: For each section, provide bullet points of essential information and talking points.

Visual Aid Suggestions: Suggest types of visual aids (e.g., simplified diagrams, flowcharts) that would complement the content.

Audience Appropriateness: Tailor the content to be engaging and informative for a general technical or semi-technical audience.

Conciseness: Ensure the content is digestible and focused, suitable for a presentation format.

Requirements (FAQs):

Common Questions: Anticipate and answer common questions that an audience might have during or after a presentation.

Clarity & Brevity: Provide clear, concise answers.

Categorization: Group related FAQs for easier navigation.

Scope: Cover questions related to the architecture, its purpose, benefits, and potential future directions.

5. Technical Considerations
The AI assistant will draw upon the following resources to fulfill the above requirements:

Architecture Diagram: "Claude Flow Architecture.jpg" (provided)

Code Repositories:

https://github.com/ruvnet/ruv-FANN

https://github.com/ruvnet/QuDAG

https://github.com/ruvnet/daa

https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow

https://github.com/ruvnet/ruv-FANN/tree/main/neuro-divergent

The AI assistant is expected to analyze the structure, purpose, and interdependencies implied by the architecture diagram and the content of these codebases to generate accurate and relevant information.

6. Success Metrics
The success of the Claude-Flow AI assistant in performing these tasks will be measured by:

Accuracy: The factual correctness of the architectural explanations and learning materials.

Clarity: The ease with which users can understand the generated content.

Completeness: The extent to which all aspects of the requirements are addressed.

Relevance: How well the generated content aligns with the context of the provided architecture and codebases.

Usability: The practicality and applicability of the learning and presentation materials.
